** TODO true k-d with special workarounds for 2d and 3d
** index/1 should return spent time or traversed branches             :0.6.0:

     not needed I believe. After some investigation I came to
     conclusion that if it will be really needed - it will be easier
     to implement on the hi-level, I mean time measure. This is the
     case when the process of indexing is taking a lot of time and
     such a measurement is consuming comparatively small amount of cpu
     time when compared to the indexing process itself. And when we're
     talking about the amount of branches traversed this will reduce
     the time to build a tree. When it comes to really significant
     amounts of data (I mean millions of points) this measurement is
     sensitive enough in means of consumed time.

     not sure if it needed or not
** TODO search/3 should return more than 1 point found
** TODO add/2 should reallocate memory and not to copy old data
** TODO insert/2 should be more outsmart to really insert, not just add and reindex
** TODO remove/2 should remove specified nodes by ids from given tree
** DONE compare/2 to compare two trees by its contents                :0.6.0:
** TODO usage examples
** TODO augment and then refine documentation
* Optional features
** TODO alternative memory managing (GC off, explicit clear/1, configurable)
** TODO application + gen_server with stored treerefs in state
** TODO possibility to load/1 and index/1 in background
