* Things that I believe should be done before 1.0 release
** TODO true k-d with special workarounds for 2d and 3d
** TODO index/1 should return spent time or traversed branches
** TODO search/3 should return more than 1 point found
** TODO add/2 should reallocate memory and not to copy old data
** TODO insert/2 should be more outsmart to really insert, not just add and reindex
