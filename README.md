yalinka

Erlang interface to k-dimensional trees

naming issues
=============

Since 'ekdtree' project already exists on a github I choose 'yalinka' as a name
for this project. You can de-cypher it using 'yet another something' pattern,
but 'yalinka' means christmas tree in ukrainian language. And now is X-mas here =)
