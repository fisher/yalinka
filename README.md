# yalinka - Erlang interface to k-dimensional trees

## Overview

This is a library for Erlang language for operating on k-d trees, implemented as a set of erlang NIF (native implemented functions).

For general information about k-d trees see [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree).

## Requirements

 * Erlang R15 or later
 * GCC, tested on 4.8
 * libc with -lm (should be available on any linux distribution by default)
 * GNU make

The C sources made with --std=C99 --Wextra --pedantic so I believe it should be easy to adopt those sources for other environments.

## Limitations

 * Points are limited by IEEE 754 double-precission (64bit) boundaries.
 * Node index is limited to uint64_t

## Installation

Just 'cd' to project directory and type 'make'. This should build the erlang application in 'ebin' directory and shared object file in 'priv/lib'.

Then set the 'DESTDIR' environment variable and type 'make install', like this:

<pre>
cd yalinka
make
DESTDIR=/usr/lib/erlang/lib make install
</pre>

Don't forget to use 'gmake' if you're *bsd follower.

## Configuration

Currently have no any configuration options.

## Usage

Autogenerated module documentation available online [here](http://yalinka.heim.in.ua/yalinka.html). The usage is actually as easy as

<pre>
{ok, Reference} = yalinka:new([{0, 0.0,0.0,0.0}, {1, 1.0,1.0,1.0}]),
{ok, {Idx, Distance}} = yalinka:search(Reference, {0.7,0.7,0.7}, 1),
</pre>

...pretty straightforward I believe.

## Naming issues

Since 'ekdtree' project already exists here on a github I choose
'yalinka' as a name for this project. Feel free to de-cypher it using
'yet another something' pattern, but actually 'yalinka' is a ukrainian
word meaning 'christmas tree'. And now is X-mas here =)
