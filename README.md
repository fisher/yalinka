# yalinka - Erlang interface to k-dimensional trees

## Overview

This is a library for Erlang language for operating on k-d trees.

(in progress since 27 dec 2013)

## Installation

TBD

## Deployment

TBD

## Configuration

TBD

## Usage

Autogenerated module documentation available online [here](http://yalinka.heim.in.ua/yalinka.html). The usage is actually as easy as

<pre>
{ok, Reference} = yalinka:new([{0, 0.0,0.0,0.0}, {1, 1.0,1.0,1.0}]),
{ok, {Idx, Distance}} = yalinka:search(Reference, {0.7,0.7,0.7}, 1),
</pre>

...pretty straightforward I believe.

## Naming issues

Since 'ekdtree' project already exists here on a github I choose
'yalinka' as a name for this project. Feel free to de-cypher it using
'yet another something' pattern, but actually 'yalinka' is a ukrainian
word meaning 'christmas tree'. And now is X-mas here =)
